Description:
The objective of this project is to build a predictive model using linear regression to estimate a
numerical outcome based on a dataset with relevant features. Linear regression is a
fundamental machine learning algorithm, and this project provides hands-on experience in
developing, evaluating, and interpreting a predictive model.
